This project contains more than 1,000 Go-based graphics code samples (think "swatches") with linear gradients, radial gradients, and transforms for rendering various 2D shapes, including rectangles, ellipses, elliptic arcs, and Bezier curves.  The code samples are in subdirectories that correspond to various equations, including Archimedean spirals, Cissoids, Cochleoids, Conchoids, Lissajous curves, and Lituus curves.

The code samples were tested successfully in Chrome (version 18) on a Macbook, and a randomly selected set of code samples rendered correctly on an Asus Prime 10" tablet with Android ICS (as expected), and most likely they will render on an iPad3 (which I'll confirm later) as well.

As you'll see, there are **many**  similar samples that are propagated through the different shape types, which might help you find the subset of code samples that are of interest to you. As you might also surmise, the Go code samples for generating the SVG code do not represent production-quality code, nor do they reflect any best practices, so it's quite possible that you can make the code more efficient by adopting best practices.

Enjoy!
